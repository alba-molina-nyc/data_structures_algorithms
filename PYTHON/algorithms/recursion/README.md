# Recursion

a function that calls itself until it does not

for example,

- think of a function called "open_gift_box" that checks if inside the gift box there is a ball
- if there is not a ball then the function will get called again
- if there is a ball then we will return the ball

## BASE CASE

BASE CASE or when the function will stop calling itself is when the function returns the ball

## RECURSIVE CASE

RECURSIVE CASE when the function calls itself again

### Important

to note to always return something AKA always have a return statement

- and that statement has to be something that is eventually true because if you do not then you are going to have a stack overflow
