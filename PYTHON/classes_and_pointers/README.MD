# Classes

- Analogous to a cookie cutter

When you create a class you are creating your own data type

## Constructor

- You want python to do particular things when you create a cookie && you do that with a CONSTRUCTOR (**init**)

### Class VS Function

- You can tell a function apart from a constructor with the keyword (self)

# You will be using Classes for every single data structure you work with in this course
